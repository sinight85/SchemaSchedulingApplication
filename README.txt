Title and Purpose:

Schema - "Scheduling in Easymode"

The purpose of this application is to provide users with a simple program that can store the company appointments and 
customers associated with those appointments. It is user-friendly in the sense that it does not allow the user to delete
any customers that may have appointments. The application also prevents the user from creating or modifying appointments 
that  may overlap with existing appointments and prevents appointments from being scheduled outside working hours.

Directions:

Upon launching the Java application, the user will be taken to the login screen. The location will display the system's 
default location and depending on the location will display in either French or English. Once the user logs in with the 
credentials of "admin" for both username and password, they will be taken to the Main Screen which will display two panes 
that feature the Appointments and Customer tables. From here the user can select an appointment/customer to edit, delete 
or click the "Create" button under the corresponding table to create a new appointment/customer. The "Reports" button will
take the user to the reports screen which can be generated by selecting one of the three radio buttons and then clicking 
"Generate". The 3rd additional report will generate a list of appointments by Location and Type. Each page in the application 
also features the fictitious company logo, Schema, which works as a "Home" button and returns the user to the main screen. 
Users can also select the "Logout" button on the main screen to be logged out and taken back to the Login page. All attempts to 
log into the application are logged into the Login_activity.txt file.
